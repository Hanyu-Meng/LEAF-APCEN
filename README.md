# Adaptive Per-Channel Energy Normalisation Front-end for Robust Audio Signal Processing

The Official Implementation of ICASSP2026 submission of LEAF-APCEN paper. Including all experiments and analysis in the paper.

## About LEAF-APCEN
The LEAF-APCEN is a novel adaptive front-end based on LEAF with simplified PCEN that tune the two parameters in PCEN by an adaptive neural controller as shown in the figure below.
